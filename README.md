# Pizza-Sales-Analysis
This Power BI dashboard project was developed as part of a self-initiated learning exercise.  The objective was to enhance data analysis and visualization skills by working on a realistic  sales dataset from a pizza business.  No external client was involved; the project was independently conceptualized, designed, and  executed by the author.
